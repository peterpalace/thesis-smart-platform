# Smart city and IoT
In this thesis I describe the creation of an IoT platform through the example of a smart city.

In particular, I focused on a platform with security and privacy as first concerns.

In the first part there is a description of what a smart city is in Europe with some real examples. This section shows the smart cities projects in Europe and that the use of technology must start from citizens needs.

In the second part there is the description of an IoT platform. This section describes the flow from a sensor (SDS011) attached to a raspberry pi model 3, to an iphotetical subject that wants this data.

I've used Mosca (MQTT Framework) and Django (Rest Framework) to implement all the services.
